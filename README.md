**AssemblyStripper** is a .NET assembly stripper aimed at generating reference assemblies.  It supports normal and mixed mode assemblies.

## Usage

1. Run `AssemblyStripper <inputDirectory>` in the console.  Every assembly discovered will be stripped into a reference assembly.
2. Check `<inputDirectory>\Stripped` for the resulting reference assemblies.
